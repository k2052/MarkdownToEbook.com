# Writing is the text

I got this. I'm going to write a book. Looks like everyone is using iBooks author these days. I guess I'll use that.
Looks like it is pretty easy to go from iBooks to PDF and more.

Wow, that is a nice template. This all looks so beautiful, my book is practically writing itself!

Writing in all these boxes is getting a bit tedious. If I wrote my text in separate files then it would faster. I know
I'd write more if I did it that way. iBooks is really for the final finished product anyway. The important thing is to
just write. Once I adopt this new workflow everything will fall into place. I'll get it written in no time.

I can write in Byword on my iPad with my Apple wireless keyboard and later on I'll sync it via Dropbox, copy it over
into iBooks throw on a template and then voila. But this font looks kinda, I don't know, cliche. Yeah, I better
customize this template a bit or I wont stand out. It wont matter how much I've written if my book doesn't stand out.
What font should I go with?

It is easy to get caught up in the non-writing part of writing.

Markdown To Ebook puts the focus back on writing. It's a no frills, no decoration, approach to writing and publishing
